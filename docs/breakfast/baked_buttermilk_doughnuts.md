* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt

## Directions

### Make the doughnuts

1. Line one baking sheet with parchment paper and another baking sheet with two layers of paper towels.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour,sugar,baking soda,baking powder, salt,nutmeg, and cinnamon.
1. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, buttermilk, and sour cream until combined.
1. Add the melted,cooled butter and whisk again.
1. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour the liquid ingredients into the well.
1. With a rubber spatula, slowly fold the flour 1. into the liquid center until the mixture forms a sticky dough.
1. Turn the dough out onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour.  Sprinkle the top of the dough with flour and pat it out until it is about1.  1/1. 2 inch thick.
1. Use two round cutters ( 3 1/4" and 1 1/2" for large doughnuts; 2 1/2" and 1 " for smaller doughnuts).  Dip the large cutter in flour and pre1. ss 1. out the rounds.  Dip the smaller cutter in the flour and cut out the center of each dough round.  Arrange both doughnuts and doughnut holes on the parchment-lined baking sheet, pat the dough scraps back together, and use them to make as many more doughnuts and doughnut holes as possible.  Chill the dough while you heat the oil.
1. Pour enough oil into a deep skillet to make a layer approximately 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches deep.  Slowly heat the oil over medium -high heat unti1. l it is 365 to 370 degrees F.
1. While you are waiting for the oil to reach temperature, make the assorted toppings.

### Make the Chocolate Dip
1. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium wide-mouthed bowl.
1. In a small saucepan, heat the cream until it is just about to boil.
1. Pour the cream over the chocolate and wait 1 minute.
1. Whisk until smooth.
1. Whisk in the butter.
1. Keep the mixture warm.

### Make the Vanilla Glaze

1. In a medium wide-mouthed bowl, whisk together the sugar, the milk, and the vanilla paste.

### Make the Cinnamon Sugar
1. In a medium wide-mouthed bowl, whisk together the sugar and cinnamon.

### To Fry the Doughnuts

1. Once the oil reaches temperature, gently lift the large doughnuts off the baking sheet and place them in the hot oil.
1. Do not crowd the skillet-make no more than 3 doughnuts at a time.
1. Once they have browned on one side (this takes 2-3 minutes), turn them over with tongs or a slotted spoon and continue to cook for another minute or just until browned (they can overcook or burn rather quickly).
1. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the doughnuts to the paper towel lined baking sheet and continue to fry the rest of the dough until finished.
1. The doughnut holes will cook faster and can be made in two or three batches after the doughnuts are done.

### Assemble the Doughnuts

1. Once you have finished frying, work quickly to dip the doughnuts in the chocolate or vanilla glaze, or the cinnamon sugar.
1. If you like, decorate the chocolate or vanilla doughnuts with sprinkles.
1. Serve immediately.

:::tip
When you fry doughnuts make sure you maintain the correct oil temperature throughout the process.  Generally speaking, doughnuts taste best served immediately after they've emerged from the fryer ( and taken a quick dip in sugar or chocolate or vanilla.  However if they don't disappear quickly when served take day old doughnuts and chop them into big coarse crumbs, toast them lightly, and add them to vanilla ice cream as a mix in (if you are making it from scratch) or a topping (if you are serving store bought). Doughnuts also work wonders (very rich wonders) when used as the base of a bread pudding.
