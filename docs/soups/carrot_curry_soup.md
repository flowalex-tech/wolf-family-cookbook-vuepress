# Carrot Curry Soup

Saute 1 onion in butter/substitute until tender

Chop up and add
1 medium potato 
6 - 8 carrots

Add 1 carton of stock (4 cups)
When tender, use your stick blender to puree

Add 1/2 cup peanut butter 
1 tsp curry powder (I have been doubling the spice for Adam but test as you go)
1 tsp cayenne
1 tsp salt

Puree again if you have chunky peanut butter and to blend in everything

Add 1 can coconut milk (recipe calls for 1/2 cup heavy cream, but you are just using something to balance flavors)
