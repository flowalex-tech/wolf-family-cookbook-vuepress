# Stirato Bread

## Ingredients

* 500 Grams (3 3/4 cups) All purpose flour ( I used bread flour)
* 375 Grams (1 2/3 cup) water 80 F
* 1/2 teaspoon (2 grams)  of active dry yeast
* 10 grams (1 tsp)  of sea salt

## Directions

:::tip
This recipe is very similar to Jim Lahey's no knead pizza dough.  There are a few differences in the technique. A little more time and patience, is required you can decide if it's worth the extra effort.
:::

1. First whisk the flour and yeast, next incorporate the water.  Mix and then make a well in the center.  Pour in the salt and let rest for 20 minutes uncovered.
2. Next, we're going to fold each corner into the center one at a time. So fold, turn the bowl and fold again.  Continue this process for about 1 minute.  Then let the dough rest for 20 minutes.
3. Continue this process 3 times, but the 3rd time you'll notice a little bounce or spring in the dough. This is ideal.
4. Now you're going to let this dough rest covered for 7 hours and the dough will double in size. It's likely best to divide this work into two days. Leaving the dough in the fridge over night is a good strategy.
5. Remove the dough and check out the beautiful air bubbles, allow dough to sit a room temp for a couple of hours. It's going to rise a bit again...
6. Preheat your Baking Steel at 450 F for about 45 minutes on the middle rack. Place a sheet tray or pan on the bottom rack at the same time, we're going to create some steam.
7. Flour a work surface with a combination of flour and semolina. Mix both well on top of parchment paper.
8. Remove the dough and place carefully on parchment.  You're going to form into a rectangle about 10 x 16, don't stress over the size.  Just not too thin....
9. Divide the dough with a bench scraper into 4 long strips and let rest for 20 minutes.
10. Now we have to launch, the back of a sheet tray is a good tool. Slide the parchment on the back side of a sheet tray.  Carefully, this dough is soft.  I did all four at the same time, an easier strategy may be to start with two, and then repeat.
11. Immediately after the launch, place 1/2 cup of water into your steam pan.  Close the oven and bake for 20 minutes until golden brown. Boom! you're done...
