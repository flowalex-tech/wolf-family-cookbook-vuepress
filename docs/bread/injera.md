# Injera

## Ingredients:

* 3 cups all purpose flour
* 1 cup buckwheat flour
* 2 tablespoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 cups club soda
* 1 cup white vinegar or rice vinegar
* Oil for pan

## Directions:

1. In a large bowl, mix both flours, salt and baking soda together. Whisk in the club soda until smooth. Then add the vinegar and whisk.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Pour oil on a paper towel and wipe the skillet with the oiled paper towel.
3. Using a scoop, pour batter into the skillet creating a 6-inch circle. Carefully swirl the pan around to thin out the batter until it measures 8- to 9-inches across.
4. Cook for 1 minute, then using a large spatula, flip the Injera over and cook another minute. Remove from the skillet and stack on a plate. Repeat with remaining batter. The Injera will seem slightly crisp in the pan, but will soften immediately when placed on the plate.
5. Once finished cooking the Injera. Cut the circles in half with a pizza cutter, roll into tubes and stack. Keep warm until ready to serve. S
