# Vegan Pulled Pork Sandwiches

## Ingredients:

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 medium onion, sliced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 cups jackfruit, fresh or canned
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon pepper
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon vegan worcestershire
* 1 teaspoon liquid smoke
* 2 cups vegetable stock
* ½ cup vegan bbq sauce

## Directions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
1. Oil a large knife and cut the jackfruit in half.
1. Carefully remove the core of the jackfruit by cutting into it at an angle.
1. Pull each fruit out and remove its seeds and outer coating. Rinse the fruit thoroughly then dry.
1. NOTE: You can save the seeds to roast.
1. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large pan or Dutch oven.
1. Add the onions and garlic, and cook until translucent.
1. Add the jackfruit, spices, Worcestershire, and liquid smoke. Stir to coat evenly.
1. Add the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes, until the liquid is mostly absorbed and the fruit has broken down.
1. Spread the jackfruit on a prepared baking sheet.
1. Bake for 75 minutes, until the liquid has baked out and the jackfruit has a deeper brown color.
1. Pour the vegan barbecue sauce over the jackfruit.
1. Mix and return to the oven for 15 minutes.
1. Serve warm on vegan buns with vegan coleslaw.
