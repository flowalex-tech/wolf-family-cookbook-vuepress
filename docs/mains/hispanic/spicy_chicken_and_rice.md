## Ingredients:

* 1 and 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or chicken thighs, or a mix)
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
* 4 Thai chili peppers, halved
* 1 tablespoon black mustard seeds
* 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
* 2 teaspoons cumin seeds, lightly crushed between your fingers
* 1 stick cinnamon
* 1 lemon, halved
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1/4 cup garlic confit (Or 4-5 garlic cloves, peeled and minced)
* 1 tablespoon black mustard seeds
* 3 Thai chili peppers, minced
* 1 cup rice
* Salt and pepper to taste

### For Serving:

* Extra virgin olive oil and minced parsley (optional)

## Directions:

### Chicken and Stock:

1. Place the chicken in a wide pot and cover with water. Add the yellow onion, crushed garlic, halved chili peppers, black mustard seeds, black peppercorns, cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, and lemon halves.
2. Cover with water and season liberally with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium and cook for 15-25 minutes or until the chicken is just cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
3. Return the stock to a boil for 10-12 minutes until reduced slightly.
4. Pour the stock into a bowl through a fine mesh sieve and discard solids. Wipe out the pot.
5. Once the chicken has cooled slightly, shred the meat with two forks or with your hands. Set aside.
6. Turn the pan to medium heat and add the garlic confit. Mash the garlic into the pan with a fork. Add the butter. Once melted and frothy, add the mustard seeds and minced Thai chili peppers. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
7. Add the shredded chicken and cook until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

### Rice:

1. Add 2-3 cups of the reserved stock and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom (reserve the remaining stock for another use). Bring to a boil and add the rice.
2. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring periodically, until the rice is cooked through. Add more liquid as necessary.
3. Remove the lid and cook, uncovered, for 5-6 minutes or until the liquid is completely absorbed. Taste and season once more.
