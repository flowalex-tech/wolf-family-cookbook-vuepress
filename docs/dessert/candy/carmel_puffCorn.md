## Ingredients

* 1 bag puff corn (about 5 ounces)
* 1 c. brown sugar
* ½ cup butter or margarine
* ¼ cup light corn syrup
* ½ tsp. vanilla
* pinch salt
* ¼ tsp baking soda

#### Crunchy Version
1. Pour puffed corn into a large bowl, large enough to stir the final mixture without making a huge mess.
1. Combine brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, vanilla and salt in saucepan.
1. Boil 4 minutes, stirring continually, if you want the crunchy version.

1. Lightly grease or spray a large cookie sheet or roaster pan.
