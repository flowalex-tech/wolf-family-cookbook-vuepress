Makes about 2 Cups
:::

### Ingredients

* 3¼ cups powdered sugar
* 2  large egg whites
* Food coloring (optional)

## Directions

1. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat powdered sugar and egg whites until white, thickened, and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes.
1. Add water by the tablespoonful until icing no longer holds a peak.
1. Divide icing into smaller bowls and color with food coloring as desired

:::tip
Raw egg is not recommended for infants, the elderly, pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems…or people who don't like raw egg. But they won't have to forgo this icing altogether: Mix 5 Tbsp. meringue powder with ⅓ cup water instead.
