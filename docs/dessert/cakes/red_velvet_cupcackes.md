## DIRECTIONS:

#### For the Cupcakes:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place cupcake papers in a cupcake pan.
1. In a large bowl, sift the dry ingredients together (including the sugar). Give it a whisk.
1. In another bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients until combined. (The batter may be clumpy! Do not worry!)
1. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Mix until combined.
1. Add the red food coloring until you reach the desired color.
1. Distribute the batter evenly into cupcake papers.
1. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden and springy to the touch.

#### For the Cream Cheese Frosting:
1. Cream the butter. Sift confectioners sugar into a large bowl.
1. Add room temperature cream cheese to the creamed butter. Add vanilla and a pinch of salt. Beat together.
1. Add the confectioners sugar in cups. Mix until combined. If you’re wanting a stronger buttercream, keep adding more sifted confectioners sugar until it’s stiff.
1. Transfer buttercream to a piping bag, snip off the tip and add a large dollop on top of each cupcake.

### Tips:
* Add more cocoa powder for a stronger chocolate taste if you don't mind a darker less RED color.
* You can store these cupcakes unfrosted at room temperature in a sealed container for 1-2 days.
* Frosting can be refrigerated and piped before serving.
* You can make one cupcake very red with extra food coloring and use that for the crumb decorations . This way the cupcakes can have less dye with all the visual pizazz!
    * Sugar in the raw  died red can be used as well
